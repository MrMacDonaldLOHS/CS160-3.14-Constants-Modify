# Constants Modify

Right now, the code uses a magic number, 8. Modify the code to use a constant instead.

The constant's name should be in ALL_CAPS and the name should be descriptive.


## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`
- You correctly used // vs. / when wanting to do integer division.
